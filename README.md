# MIPS-multiplication-game
# Uses MARS.jar

The one and only bug is when running at full speed, the variable determining who's winning move it was is just wrong.<br />
At any other speed it works fully fine

# How to play<br>
![start](start.png)<br>
![after 1 move](move.png)
- 2 pivots are present and a row of numbers from 1-9
- The computer goes first
- The product of the 2 pivots will be mapped on the 6x6 table of products of numbers from 1-9.<br>
## First to get 3 in a row either vertically or horizontally wins.

## bonus
Both the computer and user cannot input an invalid move<br>
