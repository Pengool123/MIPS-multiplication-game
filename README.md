The one and only bug is when running at full speed, the variable determining who's winning move it was is just wrong.<br />
At any other speed it works fully fine

How to play<br />
2 pivots are present and a row of numbers from 1-9.<br />
The computer goes first<br />
The product of the 2 pivots will be mapped on the 6x6 table of products of numbers from 1-9.<br />
First to get 3 in a row either vertically or horizontally wins.
